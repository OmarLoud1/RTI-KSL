# RTI-KSL
This is the code needed to have an Arduino Mega execute the RTI picture taking sequence. It turns on one of 44 LEDs that it is connected to one at a time, and takes a picture with the camera connected to the relay on pin 13 each time one of the lights is on.

# Flashing 
You will need to connect an Arduino Mega 2560 to your computer and open the .ino file in the arduino IDE. 
You can then upload that code onto the board.

# Set up

Please refer the RTI google sites for the assembly instructions
